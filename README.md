### What I learned

I learnt about local storage and how it works.
More on interactivity plus, I believe I'm getting more comfortable with javascript classes. I don't know why it confuses me often.
DOM manipulation here was a bit of a hassle, but all done thankfully.

### Continued development

Does one ever stop learning Javascript? I'll practice DOM manipulation still.

## Acknowledgments

Hmm, I'm a bit disappointed in myself that I took so long to complete this, but it's all good.
